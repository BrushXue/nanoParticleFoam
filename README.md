# nanoParticleFoam

Solve mass transport of nanoparticles in discrete model.

Replace makeThermoParcelForces.H in $WM_PROJECT_DIR/src/lagrangian/intermediate/parcels/include

Copy Thermophoretic and SphereBrownianMotion to $WM_PROJECT_DIR/src/lagrangian/intermediate/submodels/Kinematic/ParticleForces

Re-compile Lagrangian libraries.

Compile nanoParticleFoam solver.

# thermophoresisFoam

Solve mass transport of nanoparticles in a continuous model.
